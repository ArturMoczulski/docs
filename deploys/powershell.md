# PowerShell Deploy Integration

Use Invoke-WebRequest to send an HTTP POST:

```
$postParams = @{
    access_token="POST_SERVER_ITEM_ACCESS_TOKEN";
    environment="production";
    revision=$(git log -n 1 --pretty=format:"%H");
    local_username=[Environment]::UserName;
}
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://api.rollbar.com/api/1/deploy -Method POST -Body $postParams
```

Place this command in your deploy script so that it runs once the deploy has completed successfully.

If the POST is successful, you will receive a JSON response like: `{"data": {}}`. On the command\
line the output will look like this:

```
StatusCode : 200
StatusDescription : OK
Content : {
"data": {}
}
RawContent : HTTP/1.1 200 OK

[X-Content-Type-Options, nosniff]...}

```

If using a version control system other than Git, change the revision= line as appropriate to set the revision ID.
