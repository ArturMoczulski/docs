# Items

These calls require a project-level access token, which should be provided in the query string.
The prefix for all URLs is `https://api.rollbar.com`

---

## Get an item by ID

    GET /api/1/item/:id

Requires `read` scope.

`:id` must be an item ID for an item in the project. These IDs are returned as the `id` field in other API calls.

Note that they are NOT found in in URLs like "https://rollbar.com/myaccount/myproject/items/456/" -- that
is the "counter", which can be used in the following API call.


---

## Get an item by counter

    GET /api/1/item_by_counter/:counter

Requires `read` scope.

`:counter` must be an item counter for an item in the project. The counter can be found in
URLs like "https://rollbar.com/myaccount/myproject/items/456/" (456 is the counter).

The success response is a 301 redirect like this:

```
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Location: /api/1/item/272505123?access_token=abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234

{
  "err": 0,
  "result": {
    "itemId": 272505123,
    "path": "/api/1/item/272505123",
    "uri": "/api/1/item/272505123?access_token=abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234"
  }
}
```

Many HTTP clients will automatically follow the redirect.

## List all items

Returns all items in the project, in pages of 100.

    GET /api/1/items/

Requires `read` scope.


### Query String Parameters

Aside from `access_token`, `page`, and `ids`,, the query string params are the same as you might
see when using the search functionality on the "Items" part of the Rollbar UI. So you can
copy-paste the query string from the address bar while on the Items page, and use that same query
string in this API call.

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|-------------
`access_token`|`string`|**Required.** A `read`-scope project access token.
`assigned_user`|`string`|If not empty, only items assigned to the specified user will be returned. Must be a valid Rollbar username, or you can use the keywords `assigned` (items that are assigned to any owner) or `unassigned` (items with no owner).
`environment`|`string`|If not empty, only items in the specified environment will be returned. Specify multiple times to filter by multiple environments.
`framework`|`string`|If not empty, only items in the specified framework will be returned. Specify multiple times to filter by multiple frameworks.
`ids`|comma-separated list of integers|If not empty, list of item IDs to return, instead of using all items in the project.
`level`|`string`|If not empty, only items with the specified level will be returned. Valid values: `'debug'`, `'info'`, `'warning'`, `'error'`, `'critical'`. Specifiy multiple times to filter by multiple levels.
`page`|`integer`|Page number, starting from 1. 100 items are returned per page.
`query`|`string`|A query string, using the same format as the search box on the Items page.
`status`|`string`|If not empty, only items with the specified status will be returned. Valid values: `'active'`, `'resolved'`, `'muted'`. Specify multiple times to filter by multiple statuses.

### Examples

```bash
curl 'https://api.rollbar.com/api/1/items/?access_token=abcd5678&status=active&page=2'
```
