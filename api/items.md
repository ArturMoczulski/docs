# Items

These calls require a project-level access token, which should be provided in the query string. The prefix for all URLs is `https://api.rollbar.com`

<!-- Sub:[TOC] -->

## Get an item by ID

    GET /api/1/item/:id

Requires `read` scope.

`:id` must be an item ID for an item in the project. These IDs are returned as the `id` field in other API calls, and can be found in the Rollbar UI on URLs like "https://rollbar.com/item/272505123/instance/909858456/" (272505123 is the Item ID).

Note that they are NOT found in in URLs like "https://rollbar.com/project/123/item/456/" -- that is the "counter", which can be used in the following API call.


## Get an item by counter

    GET /api/1/item_by_counter/:counter

Requires `read` scope.

`:counter` must be an item counter for an item in the project. The counter can be found in URLs like "https://rollbar.com/project/123/item/456/" (456 is the counter).

The success response is a 301 redirect like this:

```
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Location: /api/1/item/272505123?access_token=abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234

{
  "err": 0,
  "result": {
    "itemId": 272505123,
    "path": "/api/1/item/272505123",
    "uri": "/api/1/item/272505123?access_token=abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234"
  }
}
```

Many HTTP clients will automatically follow the redirect.
