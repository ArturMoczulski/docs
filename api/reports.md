# Reports

This collection of API calls allows access to the same kind of reports as on the Dashboard in the UI.

These calls require a project-level access token with `read` scope, which should be provided in the query string. The prefix for all URLs is `https://api.rollbar.com`

## Top recent active items

Analogous to the "Top 10 items in last 24 hours" report on the Dashboard.

    GET /api/1/reports/top_active_items

Returns the top 10 active items in the specified environments (default "any environment"), ordered descending by level (critical first) and then descending by the count within the specied time period (default "last 24 hours").

The return value includes both the items and an array of the counts for each hour. The counts array has the oldest counts first.

### Query Parameters

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`access_token`|`string`|A `read`-scope access token for your project. Required.
`hours`|`integer`|Number of recent hours to consider. Min 1, max 168, default 24. Optional.
`environments`|`string`|Comma-separated list of environments to consider. Optional; empty means "any environment"

### Example

```bash
curl 'https://api.rollbar.com/api/1/reports/top_active_items?access_token=aaaabbbbccccddddeeeeffff00001111&hours=48&environments=production,staging'
```

### Response

Response is JSON.

```javascript
{
  "err": 0,
  "result": [
    // each element in the list is an object with an "item" object and a "counts" list
    {
        // data describing the item (similar to that returned by GET /api/1/item/:id)
        "item": {
            "id": 2071,
            "counter": 1007,
            "environment": "production",

            "level": 40,
            "occurrences": 54,
            "project_id": 12345,
            "title": "Something went wrong",
            "unique_occurrences": 5
        },
        // list of occurrence counts in the past 24 hours. Oldest first.
        "counts": [12, 10, 7, 3, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 5, 6]

## Occurrence counts

Analogous to "Hourly Error/Critical Occurrences" and "Daily Error/Critical Occurrences" on the Dashboard.

    GET /api/1/reports/occurrence_counts

Returns an array of recent counts as `[timestamp, count]` pairs, where each `count` is the number of matching occurrences in the time range `[timestamp, timestamp + bucket_size - 1]`.

Timestamps are UNIX timestamps, in whole seconds.

### Query Parameters

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`access_token`|`string`|A `read`-scope access token for your project. Required.
`bucket_size`|`integer`|Size of each bucket, in seconds. Valid values are `3600` (hour) and `86400` (day). Optional, default `86400`. Timezone for all buckets is GMT.
`buckets`|`integer`|Number of buckets to return. Must be in range `[2, 366]`. Optional, default `60`.
`environments`|`string`|Comma-separated list of environments to filter by. Optional; empty means "any environment".
`min_level`|`string`|Minimum item level to filter by. One of `debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`, or `critical`. Optional, default `error`
`max_level`|`string`|Maximum item level to filter by. One of `debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`, or `critical`. Optional, defaults to "no maximum"
`item_id`|`integer`|Item ID to filter by. Optional. Note that this is an Item *ID* (usually a 9-digit number), not an Item Counter (the shorter numbers that appear in the UI. See [Get an item by counter](/docs/api/items/#get-an-item-by-counter).

### Example

```bash
curl 'https://api.rollbar.com/api/1/reports/occurrence_counts?access_token=aaaabbbbccccddddeeeeffff00001111&bucket_size=3600&buckets=4&environments=production,staging'
