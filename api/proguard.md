To upload the `mapping.txt` file generated by ProGuard, call the `api/1/proguard` endpoint with the following params:

access_token
:	a project-level access token

version
:	a string indicating the current code version. This must match the `android:versionName` in your app's `AndroidManifest.xml`, corresponding to 	the version the `mapping.txt` was generated for.

mapping
:	the path to `mapping.txt`


Here is an example cURL command to upload a `mapping.txt` file:

```bash
curl 'https://api.rollbar.com/api/1/proguard' \
  -F access_token=POST_SERVER_ITEM_ACCESS_TOKEN \
  -F version=0.0.10 \
  -F mapping=@path/to/mapping.txt
```
