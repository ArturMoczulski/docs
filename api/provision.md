## Users

To create a new Rollbar user, call the ```provision/user``` endpoint with the following params:

  <dl>
  <dt>username</dt>
  <dd>Must be unique across all Rollbar usernames.

The username must start with a letter ```[a-zA-Z]``` followed by any ascii letter, number, "_" or "-"

  </dd>
  <dt>email</dt>
  <dd>Must be unique across all Rollbar email addresses. This will be the default email address used for all communication, including alerts and forgotten password emails.</dd>
  <dt>password</dt>
  <dd>Passwords are never stored on our servers and are encrypted via HTTPS during transmission.</dd>
  </dl>

When a new user is provisioned an account and starter project are also created.
