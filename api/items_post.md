_**Note:**  This documentation is provided for authors of custom integration libraries. If your application is built on one of our supported platforms, you can use a pre-built library instead of rolling your own._

### Overview

Rollbar receives Occurrences (exceptions and messages) via a RESTful JSON API. Clients send JSON data via an HTTP POST to `https://api.rollbar.com/api/1/item/`

We strongly recommend using HTTPS, but HTTP is also supported. For HTTP, use `http://api.rollbar.com/api/1/item/`

POSTed JSON data is accepted either as the body of the request, or form-encoded as the value of the `payload` parameter (which should be the only parameter).

All responses (including error responses) are returned as JSON.

### Simple Example

Here is a bare-bones request to report a message using Python. Note that the `access_token` is part of the JSON payload, and that the encoded JSON payload is sent as the request body.

```python
import json, requests

payload = {
  "access_token": "POST_SERVER_ITEM_ACCESS_TOKEN",
  "data": {
    "environment": "production",
    "body": {
      "message": {
        "body": "Hello, world!"
      }
    }
  }
}

json_encoded_payload = json.dumps(payload)
requests.post('https://api.rollbar.com/api/1/item/', data=json_encoded_payload)
```

If your library does not allow you to specify the raw POST body, you can send it form-encoded as the value of the <code>payload</code> parameter. For example, using Python:

```python
requests.post('https://api.rollbar.com/api/1/item/', data={'payload': json_encoded_payload})
```

### Data Format

The example JSON payload below describes all the required and optional params that Rollbar understands. The meaning of each key is explained in the comments.

```javascript
{
  // Required: access_token
  // An access token with scope "post_server_item" or "post_client_item".
  // A post_client_item token must be used if the "platform" is "browser", "flash", "android", or "ios"
  // A post_server_item token should be used for other platforms.
  "access_token": "aaaabbbbccccddddeeeeffff00001111",

  // Required: data
  "data": {

    // Required: environment
    // The name of the environment in which this occurrence was seen.
    // A string up to 255 characters. For best results, use "production" or "prod" for your
    // production environment.
    // You don't need to configure anything in the Rollbar UI for new environment names; 
    // we'll detect them automatically.
    "environment": "production",

    // Required: body
    // The main data being sent. It can either be a message or an exception.
    "body": {

      // Required: "trace", "trace_chain", or "message" (exactly one)
      // If this payload is a single exception, use "trace"
      // If a chain of exceptions (for languages that support inner exceptions), use "trace_chain"

### Response Format

#### Success

On success, this endpoint will respond with HTTP status code 200, and a JSON response like the following:

```javascript
{
  // Always present: err
  // 0 indiciates that there was no error
  err: 0,

  // Always present: result
  result: {
    // Always present: uuid
    // UUID of the posted occurrence.
    // If you provided one in the payload, this will be the value you provided
    // If you did not, one will be generated for you. 
    // You can use this later to look up the occurrence by UUID.
    uuid: "d4c7acef55bf4c9ea95e4fe9428a8287",
    
    // Deprecated: id
    // Unused; will be removed in the future
    id: null
  }
}
```

On error, this endpoint will respond with an HTTP error code 400 or higher, and a JSON response like the following:

```javascript
{
  // Always present: err
  // 1 indicates there was an error
  err: 1,

  // Always present: message
  // A human-readable message describing the error
  message: "request entity too large'
}
```

See the next section for more details about the response codes.


### Response Codes

The Items API can return the following status codes:

<dl class="dl-horizontal">
  <dt>200</dt>
    <dd><strong>Success.</strong> The item was accepted for processing.</dd>
  <dt>400</dt>
    <dd><strong>Bad request.</strong> No JSON payload was found, or it could not be decoded.</dd>
  <dt>401</dt>
    <dd><strong>Unauthorized.</strong> No access token was found in the request.</dd>
  <dt>403</dt>
    <dd><strong>Access denied.</strong> Check that your <code>access_token</code> is valid, enabled, and has the correct scope. The response will contain a `message` key explaining the problem.</dd>
  <dt>413</dt>
    <dd><strong>Request Too Large.</strong> Max payload size is 128kb. Try removing or truncating unnecessary large data included in the payload, like whole binary files or long strings.</dd>
  <dt>422<dt>
    <dd><strong>Unprocessable payload.</strong> A syntactically valid JSON payload was found, but it had one or more semantic errors. The response will contain a "message" key describing the errors.</dd>
  <dt>429</dt>
    <dd><strong>Too Many Requests</strong> - Request dropped because the rate limit has been reached for this access token, or the account is on the Free plan and the plan limit has been reached.</dd>
  <dt>500</dt>
    <dd><strong>Internal server error.</strong> There was an error on Rollbar's end.</dd>
</dl>

If you encounter any other errors, or don't understand an error you see, please [contact support](/support).
