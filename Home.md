[Gollum](https://github.com/gollum) is a simple Wiki web app that stores files in a Git repo, and provides an editing interface that commits to the underlying repo as necessary. It doesn't appear to store any metadata in the repo.

You simply cd to the repo's home directory and run gollem to launch a web server at http://localhost:4567 that gives you a web UI to edit markdown files in the repo.

Here's the repo's [README](README) file.
