# Encryption at Rest

Encryption at rest ('encryption') is currently available to customers of our [compliance solutions](/compliance/).  For more information, [contact us](/compliance/#contact-us). 
{: .info}

Once your account has encryption enabled, all newly received event data in all projects will be encrypted (_We are currently working on encryption for data that was received prior to enabling encryption and will release it soon._)

Once data in a Rollbar account is encrypted, you'll see a visual indicator next to the item titles:
