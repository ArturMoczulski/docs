# Merging Items

Item merging allows you to combine multiple items into one for easier management and more accurate metrics.  All past and future occurrences of any merged items will automatically be combined into a single 'group' item.

## Creating a new group item

To create a new group item

## Merging into an existing item

## Un-merging items

If you want to remove items from a group (e.g. because you mistakenly merged the wrong items), you can do so by goint to the item and viewing the **Member Items** tab, where you can un-merge specific or all items.

## Searching for merged items
By default, items which have been merged into a group will no longer appear in the project item feed.  To view these items, you can search for `is:member`.

To filter the item feed to only show group items, you can search for `is:group`.
