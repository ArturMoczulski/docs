title: How Rollbar Groups Occurrences

# Default Fingerprinting Algorithm

When it comes to combining similar errors, Rollbar has a few key concepts and term:

* An *occurrence* is a single event instance: an exception or log message, along with its associated metadata. 
* A *fingerprint* is a string used to identify each occcurrence (more on this below).
* An *item* is the combination of all occurrences with the same fingerprint.

Occurrences can be:

-   *exceptions*, which have an exception class, exception message, and
    stack trace. or
-   *messages*, which have only a string message

### Goals

Rollbar tries to combine occurrences such that:

-   Occurrences with the same root cause are combined
-   Occurrences with different root causes are kept separate
-   Fingerprints are resilient to deploys and code changes

When the above goals are in conflict, we generally err on the side of creating more issues. That is, we think it's better to get a few redundant notifications than to not realize an issue is happening because it was lumped together with something else.

### Exception Fingerprinting

For exceptions (including PHP and JavaScript errors), our basic fingerprinting
algorithm is:

1.  Combine the filenames and method names from all of the stack frames
2.  Append the exception class name
3.  Take the SHA1 hash of the result

The resulting SHA1 hash is used as the occurrence fingerprint.

Things to note:

-   We use all of the stack frames, not just the frame from the top of
    the stack. While this sometimes means there will be multiple Items
    for the same root cause, it also prevents unrelated issues from
    being combined together when they happen to call into the same
    library function.
-   We don't use the line numbers in the stack trace, as they often
    change due to unrelated code changes (i.e. someone added a line of
    code at the beginning of the file).
-   We don't use the exception message, as it often contains input that
    varies for each call.
-   When server.root is set, we strip the root off of each filename and replace 
    it with a constant string. So the filenames used for the fingerprint will be 
    different than if server.root is not set.

We've added a number of tweaks to this basic algorithm. Here are some of
the big ones:

-   dates and shas are stripped from paths in filenames
-   integers 2 characters or longer are stripped from method names
-   for JavaScript errors, we attempt to match the error message against
    a known database, to include data from the exception message when
    useful, and to group across browsers. Read more about JavaScript
    grouping in [the blog post](https://rollbar.com/blog/improved-grouping-for-javascript-errors).

### Message Fingerprinting

For messages, we apply a number of heuristics on the message text
itself. The basic algorithm is:

1.  Strip out things that look like data
2.  Take the SHA1 hash of what remains

Like exceptions, the resulting SHA1 hash is used as the occurrence
"fingerprint", and occurrences with the same fingerprint are combined.

"Things that look like data" includes:

-   things that look like timestamps
-   numbers with decimal points
-   integers 2 digits or longer
-   hexadecimals 4 digits of longer

### Customizing Fingerprints

If our default algorithm is separating things that you would like to see
combined, you can create rules to override the default behavior. This can be found in Settings -> Custom Fingerprinting. Please see
the [Custom Fingerprinting](https://rollbar.com/docs/custom-grouping/) guide to learn more.

### Customizing Fingerprints in Code

If our default algorithm isn't working the way you want, you can
calculate a fingerprint yourself and send it with the occurrence report.
Occurrences with the same fingerprint will be combined. The
fingerprint should be a string up to 40 characters long. If you pass a
string longer than 40 characters, we'll use its SHA1 hash instead.

} catch (\Exception $e) {
    Rollbar::log(Level::ERROR, $e, array('fingerprint' => 'abcdefg'));
}

// messages
Rollbar::log(Level::INFO, "Something went wrong", array('fingerprint' => 'hijkl'));
```
{: .tab-pane #php}

```python
# exceptions
try:
  do_something()
except:
  rollbar.report_exc_info(sys.exc_info(), payload_data={'fingerprint': 'abcdefg'})

# messages
rollbar.report_message("Something went wrong", payload_data={'fingerprint': 'hijkl'})
```
{: .tab-pane #python}

```ruby
# exceptions
begin
  do_something
rescue => e
  Rollbar.scope({:fingerprint => "abcdefg"}).error(e)
end

# messages
Rollbar.scope({:fingerprint => "abcdefg"}).error("Something went wrong")
```
{: .tab-pane #ruby}

```
See the docs for the Rollbar library you are using for instructions on how to set
specific keys in the payload. To send the fingerprint, you'll just need to set the
"fingerprint" key in the payload to the value you want.

### Customizing Fingerprinting via the API

If you're using our API directly to send us data, you can set your own
`fingerprint` by simply passing it in the JSON payload. For example:

```json
{
  "access_token": "your-post_server_item-access-token",
  "data": {
    "environment": "production",
    "body": {
      "message": {
        "body": "Something went wrong"
      }
    },
    "fingerprint": "abcdefg"
  }
}
```

The `fingerprint` should be a string up to 40 characters long. If you pass
a longer string, we'll use its SHA1 hash.
