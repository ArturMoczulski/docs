# Integrating Rollbar with Source Control

## View source from stack traces

When a Rollbar project is connected to a git repository, stack traces will include links to each file in the code version where the error was most recently activated.

## View commits in each deploy
When a Rollbar project is connected to a git repository, the list of commits included in each deploy will include URLs so you can view the diff for each commit as well as the entire deployed code version.

## View undeployed commits
When a Rollbar project is connected to a git repository, any commit that has been merged to your master branch but not yet deployed will be highlighted at the top of the Deploys screen.

## Resolve via commits
By adding an appropriately formatted message when committing a code change, you can tell Rollbar to automatically mark an item as resolved as soon as the commit is deployed to production.

```
$ git commit -m 'resolves rb#12345'
```

## Advanced options

### Server.Root

In order to let our servers know that you want it to try linking your stack trace to the files on BitBucket you should send the `server.root` key. A lot of the time that can be `/`, to indicate that all files can be linked to a file in your repository.

All [official Rollbar SDKs](../notifier/) can send this key. See the documentation for your Rollbar SDKs to learn exactly how.

An additional benefit of correctly setting `server.root` is that vendor code in your stack trace, portions that don't come from a subdirectory of `server.root`, will be collapsed. It also improves how Rollbar groups that error. We strip off `server.root` from your code where possible before using the filenames as part of the [fingerprint](../grouping-algorithm/#exception-fingerprinting). This means you can host the code from varying locations on your servers, and still correctly see otherwise identical errors as part of a single group.

Code that is considered in-project because of the `project_package_paths` key will not be linked to your repository at this time.

## Setup Instructions
To connect a Rollbar project to your git repository, just follow the steps on one of the following pages.

* [GitHub](../github/)
* [Bitbucket](../bitbucket/)
* [GitLab](../gitlab/)
