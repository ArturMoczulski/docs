# Integrating Rollbar with Source Control

Rollbar can be integrated with your Github, Bitbucket, or Gitlab repository.  When Rollbar is connected to your source conrol system, new debugging features are unlocked.

## Links from stack traces to source code

When a Rollbar project is connected to a git repository, stack traces will include links to each file in the code version where the error was most recently activated.

## Links from deploys to commits
When a Rollbar project is connected to a git repository, the list of commits included in each deploy will include URLs so you can view the diff for each commit as well as the entire deployed code version.

## View undeployed commits
Any commit that has been merged to your master branch but not yet deployed will be highlighted at the top of the Deploys screen.

## Resolve items via commit messages
By adding an appropriately formatted message when committing a code change, you can tell Rollbar to automatically mark an item as resolved as soon as the commit is deployed to production.

```
$ git commit -m 'resolves rb#12345'
```
