# Integrating Rollbar with Source Control

Rollbar can be integrated with your Github, Bitbucket, or Gitlab repository.  When Rollbar is connected to your source conrol system, new debugging features are unlocked.

## Link from stack traces to sources

When a Rollbar project is connected to a git repository, stack traces will include links to each file in the code version where the error was most recently activated.
