{: info}

If you exceed your monthly event limit, you can now pay *per event* over the limit.  If your overage charge is sufficiently high that it would be more economical to upgrade to the next plan, then we'll do it for you automatically and you won't be charged for the overages.  Here's how it works:

| Plan	| Monthly Cost	| Events/ Month	| Cost per 1,000 events over limit	| *We'll automatically upgrade you if your overage reaches...* |
|-------|----------------|---------------|-----------------------------------|----------|
| Bootstrap |	$49	| 100,000 |	$1.00	| 100,000 events \n ($100.00) |
| Startup | $149	| 500,000	| $0.60 |	250,000 events \n ($150.00) |
| Growth	| $299	| 1,500,000 |	$0.40 |	750,000 events | ($300.00) |
| Premium	| $599	| 4,000,000 |	$0.30 |	N/A |
