# Connect Rollbar to your Issue Tracker

Rollbar can integrate with [many popular issue trackers](/docs/tools/#issue-tracking) so you can manage Rollbar-detected errors in your existing workflow.

## Issue Tracking Options

When Rollbar is connected to your issue tracker you can _manually_:

* **Create** an issue to track a Rollbar error.
* **Link** a Rollbar error to an existing issue.

Additionally, Rollbar can be configured to _automatically_:

* **Create** an issue for new or frequently-occurring errors.
* **Reopen** a linked issue when a Rollbar error is reactivated or reopened by a user.
* **Resolve** a linked issue when a Rollbar error is resolved.
