## Install the gem

Add to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rollbar', '~> 2.7.1'
```

Then run:

```shell
bundle install
```

If you don't use bundler:

```
gem install rollbar
```


## Add Rollbar to Your Rails Application

Run the following command from your Rails root:

```bash
rails generate rollbar {{ server_access_token }}
```

That will create the file ```config/initializers/rollbar.rb```, which initializes Rollbar and holds your access token and other configuration values.

If you want to store your access token outside of your repo, run the same command without arguments and create an environment variable ```ROLLBAR_ACCESS_TOKEN``` that holds your server-side access token:

```bash
$ rails generate rollbar
$ export ROLLBAR_ACCESS_TOKEN={{ server_access_token }}
```

For Heroku users:

If you're on Heroku, you can store the access token in your Heroku config:

```bash
$ heroku config:add ROLLBAR_ACCESS_TOKEN={{ server_access_token }}
```

To confirm that your application is properly configured, run:

```bash
$ rake rollbar:test
```

This will raise an exception within a test request; if it works, you'll see a stacktrace in the console, and the exception will appear in the Rollbar dashboard.
