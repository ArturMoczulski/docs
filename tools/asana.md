# Connecting Asana to Rollbar

Turn application errors in your [Rollbar](https://rollbar.com/) projects into Tasks in your
[Asana](https://asana.com/) Projects.

### In Rollbar

1. Visit the Settings page in Rollbar and go to Notifications. From the Notifications Settings you
   will select Asana from the list of "Available Channels".

5. You can also link an Item in Rollbar to an existing Asana Task. When viewing an Item, select the
   drop down next to the Asana button and then click "Link existing Asana Task" and copy and paste
   the URL for the Asana Task you would like to link.

Congratulations! You have now integrated Rollbar with your Asana account. Events from Rollbar will
automatically create Tasks on your Asana Projects. If you want, you can customize the default rules
by editing, adding, or deleting them.
