## How to Integrate VictorOps with Rollbar

You can turn Rollbar events into Alerts in [VictorOps](https://victorops.com/).

### Setup

Configuration is per-project in Rollbar.

1.  Head to the Notification settings page for a project: Dashboard -> Settings -> Notifications -> VictorOps.

5.  Congrats! You have now integrated Rollbar with your VictorOps
    account. Now, when a new error or higher occurs in Rollbar, it will create an Alert in VictorOps, and
    Alerts in VictorOps will be automatically resolved when they are resolved in Rollbar. If you want, you can customize the default
    rules by editing, adding, or deleting them.
