## Using Rollbar inside Help Scout

If you use [Help Scout](https://www.helpscout.net/) for support, you can
integrate it with Rollbar to see recent errors that affected your users
who write in to support.

The Rollbar app will appear on the right sidebar in the Conversation
view. It looks like this:
