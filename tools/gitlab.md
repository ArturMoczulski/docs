# Connect Rollbar to Gitlab

## Set up Linking

Each line in your stack trace can be linked to your code in GitLab if it's hosted in a single repository. This has to be done once per project.

1. Go to the Settings section of your project then click on Source Control.

## Viewing GitLab Source Code from Rollbar
Once you've successfully connected to a GitLab repository, Rollbar error tracebacks and deploy reports will include links to specific lines of code and revisions in your repository.

## Creating GitLab Issues from a Rollbar Project

5. You can also link an Item in Rollbar to an existing GitLab Issue. When viewing an Item, select the
   drop down next to the GitLab button and then click "Link existing GitLab Issue" and copy and paste
   the URL for the GitLab Issue you would like to link.

Congratulations! You have now integrated Rollbar with your GitLab account. Events from Rollbar will
automatically create Issues in your GitLab repositories. If you want, you can customize the default rules
by editing, adding, or deleting them.
