Each line in your stack trace can be linked to your code in Gitlab if it's hosted in a single repository. This has to be done once per project.

1. Go to the Settings section of your project then click on Source Control.

## Viewing Gitlab Source Code from Rollbar
Once you've successfully connected to a Gitlab repository, Rollbar error tracebacks and deploy reports will include links to specific lines of code and revisions in your repository.
