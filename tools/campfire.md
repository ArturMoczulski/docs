### Setup

Configuration is per-project in Rollbar.

    Settings -> Notifications -> Campfire.
2.  Enter your Campfire API token and Account, and click "Enable Campfire Integration".
3.  Congrats! Campfire is now integrated with Rollbar. Default rules will
    have been created for the various events that Rollbar notifies on.
    You can customize the rules by editing them, deleting them, or
    adding new ones.
