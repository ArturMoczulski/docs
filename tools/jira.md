## In JIRA

In order to connect Rollbar to JIRA, you must configure an Application Link between Rollbar and JIRA.

* Go to **Settings --> Applications --> Application Links**, enter the URL `https://rollbar.com` and click **Create New Link**
* In the form that appears, enter the following values:
  * Application Name: `Rollbar`
  * Application Type: `Generic Application`
  * Service Provider Name: `Rollbar`
  * Consumer Key: `OauthKey`
  * Shared Secret: `Rollbar`
  * Request Token URL: `https://rollbar.com`
  * Access Token URL: `https://rollbar.com`
  * Authorize URL: `https://rollbar.com`
  * Create incoming link: `Checked`
 
* Click **Continue** and then enter the following values in the next screen:
  * Consumer Key: `OauthKey`
  * Consumer Name: `Rollbar`
  * Public Key: 
    
    ```
    -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----

    FYpOk+QvYrvi2YZFEwIDAQAB
    -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
    ```

* Click **Continue**.  JIRA should finish configuring the application link then display the message 
  ```
  Application Link 'Rollbar' created successfully.
  ```

## In Rollbar

* Go to **Settings --> Notifications --> Available Channels --> JIRA**.
* If no users in the project have configured a JIRA credential, then you will need to enter the URL of your JIRA server to set up a default credential for the project.  Otherwise, you can select from the available credentials in the project.
  * If you wish to set up an additional JIRA credential for use as the project default, then go to **User Settings --> Connected Accounts --> JIRA** to complete the configuration.
* Select a `JIRA Project` and `Issue Type` for the linked issues created for the Rollbar Project
* By default, each Rollbar user must have a JIRA credential configured in order to use the **Create Issue** button in the item view.  If you would like for project members to be able to use the default project credential rather than entering their own, then check `Use default credentials if user has not connected to JIRA`.
* Click **Send Test Notification** to verify that issues can be created in your JIRA project.
* Click **Enable** to turn on the integration.

For detailed instructions on using and configuring automatic and manual issue tracking integration, check out the [Issue Tracking guide](../issue-tracking/).
