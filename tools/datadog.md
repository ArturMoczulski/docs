Improve your monitoring and connect Rollbar to Datadog. Rollbar users can syndicate exceptions,
errors and code deployments as 'Events' in [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/). Installation
instructions below.

### Setup

Configuration is per-project in Rollbar.

1. On Datadog, head to the APIs page to get your API Key (copy to your clipboard): Integrations → APIs.

4. Click Enable Datadog Integration

Congrats! Datadog is now integrated with Rollbar. Once integrated, the default notification 'Rules'
will be activated and sent to your Datadog account.

## Customizing Datadog Events

The Datadog event created by each notification rule can be customized using [notification variables](/docs/notification-variables/) and filters.  Additionally, you may specify a different API key for each notification rule if you wish to send the events to a different Datadog account.

## Automatic event priority
When creating an event in Datadog from Rollbar, you can explicitly set the priority (`low`, `normal`) or allow Rollbar to automatically determine the priority.  Here's how priority is automatically determined:

Rollbar Notification Rule | Datadog Priority
-------------|-----------------
Item resolved | `low`
_Everything else_ |	`normal`

## Automatic event type
When creating an event in Datadog from Rollbar, you can explicitly set the type (`error`, `warning`, `info`, `success`) or allow Rollbar to automatically determine the priority.  Here's how priority is automatically determined:

Rollbar Notification Rule | Datadog Event Type
--------------------------|-------------------
Deploy | `info`
Item resolved | `success`
_Everything else_ | _determined by Rollbar item level_

Rollbar item levels are mapped to Datadog event types as follows:

Rollbar Item Level |	Datadog Event Type
-------------------|--------------------
`critical`, `error` | `error`
`warning` |	`warning`
`info`, `debug` |	`info`
