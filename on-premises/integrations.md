# Integrations Configuration

Certain third-party integrations require your own credentials from the third-party service. You can configure these credentials in `mox.ini`.

## Google OAuth

Create an OAuth app in your Google account, then note its Client ID and Client Secret. Set these as `google.client_id` and `google.client_secret` in `mox.ini`.
