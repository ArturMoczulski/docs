# Multiple Hosts

Before you read this, take a moment to familiarize yourself with the 
[Rollbar On-Premise architecture](architecture.md "Rollbar On-Premise Architecture") and 
the [advanced configuration](configure.md#advanced "Advanced Rollbar Configuration") 
documentation.

You can install Rollbar on one or more hosts. Before you start, you will need to determine 
which services you want to run on the extra hosts. Below are some common choices:

- Run your MySQL database on a separate, dedicated host
  - Run your own managed MySQL database - See the [Advanced Configuration](configure.md#advanced "Advanced Rollbar Configuration") instructions.
  - Run the bundled MySQL database that came with the On-Premise distribution
- Run extra Rollbar data pipeline workers
- Add capacity to the Rollbar API tier by adding more API servers
- Add capacity to the Rollbar Web tier by running more Web servers

For a full list of the different services you can install and run, see the 
[configuration](configure.md "Rollbar Configuration") documentation.

## Requirements

- Download and unarchive the *.tar.gz* file onto your hosts
- The *.settings* file from your original Rollbar host copied onto your other hosts
- The private IP address of your original Rollbar host to use with the **--join** flag
  - To get this, run the following on your original Rollbar host
    ```sh
    ifconfig `grep IFACE .settings | awk 'BEGIN {FS="\""};{print $2}'`
    ```

## Configure

Next, run the *configuration.sh* script on your new hosts but this time, specify which services 
you would like to install and run.

### Run the bundled MySQL database
  ```sh
  ./configure.sh -f path/to/settings/file --join IP --services mysql --save
  ```
  
### Run extra Rollbar workers
  ```sh
  ./configure.sh -f path/to/settings/file --join IP --services worker --save
  ```
  
### Add capacity to the Rollbar API/Web tier
  ```sh
  ./configure.sh -f path/to/settings/file --join IP --services api,web --save
  ```
