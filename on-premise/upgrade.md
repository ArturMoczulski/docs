**Note:** The upgrade process currently requires stopping all Rollbar services before performing the upgrade. 
During this time, errors will not be captured. We will provide a zero-downtime upgrade process in 
a future release.

1. Download the new On-Premise distribution *.tar.gz* file
2. Uncompress and unarchive

   ```sh
   cd rollbar-enterprise_2016-03-01 && ./install.sh
   ```
3. Stop all Rollbar services
   
   If Rollbar is running on multiple hosts, perform this step on each host
   
   ```sh
   ./stop.sh
   ```
4. Install the new version

   ```sh
   ./install.sh
   ```
5. Configure using your previous settings

   The settings file from your previous install will be stored in the directory 
   you uncompressed the original archive into. Copy this file into the new distribution directory
   and name it ".settings".
   
   ```sh
   ./configure.sh -f .settings --save
   ```
6. Start/upgrade to the new version

   ```sh
   ./start.sh --run-migrations
   ```
